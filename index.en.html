		<h1>It's not you, it's me: Why and how to encrypt email you send</h1>
		<p>Privacy is not only a good idea, it is also a basic human right. Consider encrypting email you send to not only improve your own privacy, but also others'.</p>

		<h2>Why you should care</h2>
		<p><img src='img/photo_rikva_01' id='postcard' alt='Image of a postcard'/>Normally<sup><a id='footref1' href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> when you send an email it is possible for both your and the receiver's internet service providers (e.g. your workplace, local telephone or cable company) to read its contents. The same applies for the receiver of the email. Think of it like a normal postcard: anyone who works with handling the mail can read what you have written.</p>
		<p><img src='img/Machovka_Toilet' id='toilet' alt='Image of a person on a toilet'/>Would you be comfortable writing all your letters on postcards? Probably yes. After all, you don't have anything to hide, right? Many others, however, value their privacy. Everyone knows what happens when you go to the toilet. It is no secret. Yet we prefer to keep the door locked, because we value privacy<sup><a href='#footnote2' id='footref2'>2</a></sup>.</p>
		<p><img src='img/Archie_Mahatma_Gandhi' id='gandhi' alt='Image of Mahatma Gandhi'/>But there are also people who really <em>need</em> privacy in their communication. Think of e.g. peaceful activists who might be spied on by governments to make their lives more difficult. By protecting <em>all</em> mail, it makes it more difficult for governments to identify and harass people who actually do need the protection.</p>
		<h2>What you should do</h2>
		<p>Setting up encryption requires about 30 minutes and may seem slightly technical. However, after following the instructions below, sending encrypted email is almost as easy as sending unencrypted email.</p>
